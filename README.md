## 3. Messages
- This framework allows us to create **sticker packs** and **iMessage apps** both in the _standalone app_ way and in the _child app extension_ way.

### As example
1. iMessage child app extension to send stickers based on in-line Google results of images.
2. iMessage app extension to save phrases and be able to send them easily.

### As iMessage App Extension
- `MSMessagesAppViewController` is a subclass of `UIViewController`.
- `MSMessagesAppViewController` allows us to have both compact and expanded view modes.
